# COLLABORATOR README

## Project: Simple Shell

Welcome to the collaborator readme file for the Simple Shell project! This project was built from scratch by Olamide and Mohammed as part of our collaboration for ALX.

### Project Overview

The Simple Shell project aims to develop a basic shell program that can execute commands and provide a command-line interface to interact with the underlying operating system. The shell supports various features, including executing built-in commands, handling external commands through forking and executing child processes, managing environment variables, and more.

### Collaborator Information

#### Olamide

- **Name:** Olamide
- **Role:** Software Engineer & MSLA @Microsoft
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Implemented the core functionalities of the shell, such as command execution, input parsing, and handling built-in commands.
  - Worked on the implementation of the command history feature.
  - Collaborated with Mohammed to ensure smooth integration of different components.
  - Conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure the shell's reliability.

#### Mohammed

### Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple source code files, each responsible for a specific component or functionality. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- `shell.c`: The main file that contains the entry point of the shell program.
- `shell.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and structure definitions used throughout the project.
- `command_execution.c`: Implementation of command execution and related functionalities.
- `input_parsing.c`: Implementation of input parsing and handling of command line arguments.
- `builtins.c`: Implementation of built-in commands.
- `history.c`: Implementation of command history feature.
- `utils.c`: Utility functions used across different parts of the shell.
- `Makefile`: Makefile for compiling and building the shell program.

### Getting Started

To run the Simple Shell program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from the provided source.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Use the provided `Makefile` to compile the shell program by running the command `make`.
4. Execute the shell by running the generated executable.
5. You can now start interacting with the shell by entering commands.
